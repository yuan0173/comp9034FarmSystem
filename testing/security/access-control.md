## 📋 Security Usage Guidelines

### 1. Testing Environment Only
- All credentials and configurations are for testing environment only
- Do not use test credentials in production systems
- Test data should not contain real personal information

### 2. Credential Management
- **PIN Rotation:** Test account PINs should be rotated monthly
- **Access Logging:** Important operations are recorded in audit logs
- **Shared Access:** Coordinate usage to avoid account conflicts

### 3. Data Protection
- Do not use test data for purposes outside of testing
- Do not share test credentials outside authorized team members
- Report any suspected security issues immediately

### 4. Network Security
- Access only from authorized networks
- Use HTTPS connections only
- Verify SSL certificates are valid

## 🛡️ Security Boundaries
